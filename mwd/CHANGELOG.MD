0.4.0 -- May 10

This update added deployment, integration testing and photo upload.

0.3.0 -- April 12

This update adds an authentication feature. However, it does not work entirely as intended. It properly authenticates users and redirects to the home page, and it prevents unauthenticated users from visiting protected pages. However, the home page does not display for protected users. The link can be visited, but the page is blank.

0.2.0 -- March 29

Redesigned internal structure to incorporate modular architecture. Utilized create-react-app and JSX. App now allows user to enter task information and uploads it to a back4app database.

0.1.0 -- March 15

Created basic app to allow users to input tasks with relevant information. Currently uses dummy data and does not do anything with user data.
