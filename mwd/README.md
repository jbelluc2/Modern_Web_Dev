In order to run this code locally, no packages have to be installed.

For deployment, I installed Github Pages using "npm install gh-pages --save-dev". To deploy an changes I type "npm run deploy".

For integration testing, I needed to install cypress by typing "npm install cypress --save-dev". To run my tests I simply type "npm run tests".

Additionally, I already have my code up and running at the following link:

***** Important note: my partner and I use the same database but with different information. Since I can't clean the data he enters into the database, my website will sometimes produce errors. If you are unable to view my website, this is why. Send me an email at jbelluc2@nd.edu and I'll manually fix something in the parse database that will take care of it.
